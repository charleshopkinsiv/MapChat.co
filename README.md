## Chat With Your Neighbors!
This app was built to bring local communities together for discussion. You can place a chat room anywhere on a map so that people in your area can find you and spark up a conversation.

# How it was built

## JavaScript
MapChat is a single page application so it utlizes JavaScript for most actions.

## Google Maps API
MapChat is built using the Google Maps API and stores GPS coordinates and pulls them from a mySQL database.

## PHP
PHP is called by the Fetch API using JavaScript for all of the back end work.

## Sass
The main style.css file is compiled from many different SASS files to keep things organized and efficient.
